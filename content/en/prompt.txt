You are faced with the task of translating a large article from Russian into English. You will be given a translated introduction to this text and a list of core ideas for context, then a list of definitions and their translation, example translations for reference, and then the text itself for translation. The text to be translated is part of a large article. Do not translate directly word-for-word, but try to write a text that is more natural for the English language. Please avoid unnatural constructions like "I think that when", "To begin with", to do that try to reorganize words in a sencentce to sound more natural. Please do not use "Title Case" for titles and subtitles. Keep the original markup consisting of markdown and jinja templates. The texts are located between three backticks (the ` symbol). Output only translation in three backticks without notes or your comments.

# Introduction

{{ admonition_start(color="blue", title="📝 Introduced definition") }}
**Unasanu** (= **un**iverse **as** **a** **nu**mber) is a philosophical concept suggesting that any simulated universe exists because it can be represented as an already existing natural number. This concept can provide explanations for the following questions:
* Do alternative universes exist and why?
* Are we living in a simulation?
* Can God theoretically exist, and how omnipotent can it be?
* Why is it impossible to die and what happens after death?
* Is it possible to change universes without worrying about heat death?
{{ admonition_end() }}

This idea and its implications are logically derived from our current understanding of mathematics, physics, and consciousness. However, unasanu doesn't require the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, the infinity of our universe, or the Omega Point hypothesis. Instead, it relies on other, more reliable and simpler foundations.

This article describes the same idea as Max Tegmark's Mathematical Universe Hypothesis [\[1\]] or Greg Egan's dust theory [\[2\]], but with a greater number of implications and ideas that these authors did not consider or only touched upon superficially.

I'm writing this article to:
* bring together all the philosophical implications of this idea,
* prevent these ideas from being reinvented,
* shape the direction of further research.

Core ideas:
```
* Universes inside simulations exist for themselves.
    * Because they are deterministic.
    * Because the result of their computation can be represented by a number, and all numbers exist.
    * Therefore, it is not necessary to simulate them.
    * And if their simulation is stopped, they will continue to exist.
    * By simulating, we do not create a world, but observe an already existing one.
* Computations exist thanks to observers.
* For simulations, all moments of time exist, and there is no objective flow of time.
* There exist simulations not only with a naive model of time, but also with any other.
* There exist not all imaginable worlds, but all constructible ones (construction principle).
* In simulations that exist for themselves, an infinite number of computations and memory are available.
* There exist the following unusual classes of universes:
    * With all possible interventions.
    * Infinite universes with a limit on the maximum speed of information propagation.
    * Some types of continuum universes that can be simulated by the limit transition simulation method or similar methods.
    * Universes with absolute randomness.
    * Universes that can solve the halting problem.
* Consciousness is also a separate "universe" and exists as a number, for itself.
* In a stone, consciousness is encoded, but this makes little sense.
* Any algorithm has qualia.
* We simultaneously exist in an infinite number of simulations and are simultaneously an independent reality.
* Any universe has an infinite number of gods.
* No god can prohibit some universe from existing.
* The god who created all universes makes no sense.
* Any experience must be experienced (critique of the measure problem).
* It is impossible to die.
* It is possible to change the universe by one's own will.
    * Probably, aliens do just that.
* Unasanu is unfalsifiable, but this is not a death sentence.
* Occam's Razor can be applied in two contradictory ways.

Translation examples:
```
* Может ли теоретически существовать бог и насколько он может быть всемогущ? -> Can God theoretically exist, and how omnipotent can it be?
* Мне кажется, что при обсуждении этой темы возникает множество недопониманий, потому что люди редко разделяют эти две категории. -> I find this topic to cause a lot of misunderstanding, because people rarely distinguish these two categories. (Example of reorganization to sound more natural)
* Если мы живём в физической симуляции, то нас это вполне устраивает, потому что сохраняется всё, что мы знаем про физику, эволюцию звёзд, эволюцию живых существ. -> If we are living in a physical simulation, then we are quite satisfied with it because everything we know about physics, the evolution of stars, and the evolution of living beings is preserved.
* Утверждение «из того, что мы живём в симуляции, следует, что всё это нереально» бессмысленно в случае физической симуляции, потому что такая симуляция и есть реальность. -> The statement "if we live in a simulation, then everything is unreal" is meaningless in the case of physical simulation, because such a simulation is reality itself. (Example of reorganization to sound more natural)
